## Overview
### The challenge

The game is written with HTML, SASS, and JS. Users are able to choose between rock, scissors, or paper. 
The computer's choice is generated randomly. The game reads the inputs and records the winnings for each player. 
If the player and the computer chose the same hands, the game counts it as a tie.
