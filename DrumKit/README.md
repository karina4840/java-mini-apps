## Overview
### The challenge

The game is written with HTML, SASS, and JS. The Drum Kit app displays some of the keyboard keys. 
Each key is assigned to a specific sound of a drum. The keys can be pressed or clicked in order 
to play the sound. To detect which key was activated I used switch statement.
